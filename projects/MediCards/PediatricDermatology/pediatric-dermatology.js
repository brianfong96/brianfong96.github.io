      answer:
        '<ul><li>Mild disease: topical benzoyl peroxide ± topical retinoid; add topical antibiotic only in combination with benzoyl peroxide.</li><li>Moderate to severe: continue topicals and add oral doxycycline or minocycline for limited courses.</li><li>Severe, scarring, or refractory cases: consider oral isotretinoin and dermatology referral.</li></ul>',

      explanation:
        '<p>Combination topical therapy targets follicular keratinization and inflammation. Oral antibiotics reduce inflammatory lesions but should be paired with benzoyl peroxide to deter resistance and limited to about 3 months. Hormonal modulation (combined oral contraceptives or spironolactone) supports female patients when age-appropriate. Early isotretinoin prevents scarring in nodulocystic acne.</p>',
