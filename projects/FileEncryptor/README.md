# File Encryptor

This tool generates a deterministic password using the same algorithm as R.P.R.P.G. and uses it to encrypt or decrypt files directly in your browser. Provide the same inputs and you'll be able to decrypt files that were previously encrypted.

## Usage
1. Fill out the form fields.
2. Choose a file to encrypt or decrypt.
3. Click **Encrypt** to download an encrypted `.enc` file or **Decrypt** to restore the original file.

The encryption key is never stored or transmitted. All operations happen locally.
